# Printing Library

The printing library enables you to collect printer related information.

The library contains the following classes:

- cDefaultPrinter - Getting and setting (if allowed) of the current default printer
- cDeviceCapabilities - Retrieves device capabilities. This class is used in the Printer Driver Analyzer tool cPrinterDriversHandler - Use this class to enumerate the available printer drivers
- cPrinterFormsHandler - Use this class to enumerate the forms supported by a printer driver
- cPrinterJobsHandler - Use this class to enumerate the jobs for a printer
- cPrinterPortsHandler - Use this class to enumerate the printer ports
- cPrintersHandler - Use this class to get the current status of a printer and to enumerate the listed Windows printers

##### Note
The [DateAndTime Library](https://github.com/DataFlex-dev/DateAndTime/) is needed to be able to use this library
